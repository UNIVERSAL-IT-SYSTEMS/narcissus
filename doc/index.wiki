<h3>What is it?</h3>

Narcissus is a very simple program that allows the use of gamepads (or other
XInput2 keyboard devices) as chording keyboards under X11.

What's a chording keyboard? It's a keyboard where you press combinations of
keys in order to produce letters. Because you don't need one key per letter,
you get very much fewer keys, and so can easily type one handed. Theoretically
they can also be faster than a conventional keyboard but I have my doubts. 
But because they're one handed, you can type while using your other hand for
something else --- beer, say, or using the mouse.

Narcissus was written to work with the Razer Nostromo (hence the name). That's
one of these:

<p><img style="width:50%" alt="[Picture of the Razer Nostromo]"

It'll work with other keypads, including the left-handed version of the
Nostromo, and <i>also</i> including conventional keyboards provided they
support n-key rollover, but I don't have keymaps for them. Implementing your
own keymap for Narcissus should be trivial. If you've got a device you want to
make work, please get in touch --- I'd love to support more devices.



<h3>What's new?</h3>

Nothing yet --- I haven't made a proper release!



<h3>How do I use it?</h3>

Download and build it. Right now you have to check out the repository. Build
instructions are in the <a href="../README?mimetype=text/plain">README</a>.
Once built, run it with:

<verbatim>./narcissus</verbatim>

...and it should autodetect your device and Just Work.

Once it's running, typing on the keypad should make letters appear on your
desktop. Narcissus runs in parallel with your existing keyboard, so you can
always go back to that if you want to.

The keymap is very much in flux, so rather than provide documentation here
where it'll instantly become wrong, I'll just <a
href="../src/razer-nostromo.c">link to the relevant source file</a>. Hopefully
it'll be readable. However, in general:

  *  Combinations on the <b>top</b> row produce <b>lower case letters</b>
  *  The same combinations on the <b>middle</b> row produce <b>upper case
     letters</b>
  *  <b>Button 11</b> is a modifier which causes the top two rows to
     produce the obvious <b>numbers</b>
  *  The thumb button is a modifier which acts as <b>control</b> on the
     <b>top row</b> and <b>alt</b> on the <b>middle row</b> (sorry, no
	 meta or more complex combinations yet)
  *  <b>Symbols</b>, <b>space</b>, <b>delete</b> and <b>return</b> are
     produced by combinations spanning the <b>top two rows</b>.

To quit, Ctrl+C it. <b>Don't do this using Narcissus itself</b> or else it'll
die before it has a chance to release the keys and your desktop will think
you're holding Ctrl+C down.

To <i>learn</i> the keymap, a simple tutorial program, nartutor, is included.
See the <a href="../README?mimetype=text/plain">README</a> for details.



<h3>Why should I use it?</h3>

Chording keyboards are awesome. Hard to use, but awesome. Being able to enter
text using just one hand means that you can do something with the other hand.
Douglas Engelbart, who pretty much invented the mouse, intended to use a
chording keyboard in the other hand. <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY">See his seminal 1968
demo</a>.

Court stenographers use <a
href="http://www.acrdepos.com/wordpress/how-does-a-stenograph-work/">two-hand
chording keyboards</a> to allow them to write at 225 words per minute and keep
up with debate in courtrooms. The record is 375, I believe.

They're also invaluable for people who have, say, one hand. I'm particularly
interested because, while I do have two hands, pretty much everything I do
revolves around keyboards, and I live in dread of RSI. Being able to type one
handed would allow me to use one hand at a time in a totally different style.

There have been <a href="http://twiddler.tekgear.com/">lots of</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FrogPad">chording</a> <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwriter">keyboards</a> <a
href="http://chordite.com/">made over the years</a>, but they're all esoteric,
exotic, expensive and usually very hard to find. But gamepads are booming, and
they're typically ergonomic and easy to find.

I have found a few other pieces of software that do what Narcissus does, but
I've never made them work; Narcissus is small, simple and tailored for what I
want. Hopefully it'll be useful for other people too.



<h3>Why shouldn't I use it?</h3>

Learning the keymap is a major undertaking, and will take lots of practice. Me, I
suck. I can type E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H and sometimes R.
