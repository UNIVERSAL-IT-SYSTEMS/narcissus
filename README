INTRODUCTION
============

Narcissus is a simple tool which allows you to use a Razer Nostromo gaming
keypad (or, potentially, other similar devices) as a chording keyboard,
where different letters are produced by pressing combinations of keys.

The Nostromo is one of these:

The keymap is moderately complicated by Narcissus also includes --- totally
free! --- a simple tutorial tool which will teach you how to use it.


INSTALLATION
============

In order to use Narcissus, you will need:

 - Xlib
 - libfakekey 
   This is available practically everywhere --- I used the version in Debian.

Narcissus is written in simple C99 and should be pretty portable.


USAGE
=====

To use:

  $ narcissus &

It will automatically detect a connected device and start interpreting keys.

To use the tutor:

  $ nartutor [-l<level>] [-f<dictionary>]

<dictionary> should be a wordlist; if you don't specify the -f option, then
/usr/share/dict/words is used.

<level> is the start level; i.e. the number of letters you know. If you don't
specify the -l option, you start at 1.

nartutor will show you the keymap for your device at the level you chose, and
then prompt you with words to type in. When it runs out of words, it'll
advance to the next level. If you get bored, ^C it and increase the level
manually.


ISSUES
======

It's not very configurable (read: not configurable), the keymap is subject to
change without notice, and nartutor only knows about alphabetic keys.


LICENSE
=======

Narcissus is available under the two-clause BSD license. Please see the
COPYING file for the full text.


REVISION HISTORY
================

Unreleased.
